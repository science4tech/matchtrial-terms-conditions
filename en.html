    <h3>1. DEFINITIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>TERMS:</strong> Refers to these Terms of Service, including the Privacy Policy referred to below. </p>
    <p><strong>MATCHTRIAL:</strong> Refers to SCIENCE4TECH SOLUTIONS, SLU, a company with registered office in Recinto Modernista Sant Pau,

    <p><strong>CLINICAL STUDY:</strong> Any research involving persons intended to:
    <ol>
        <li>Discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological or other pharmacodynamic effects of one or more drugs.</li>
        <li>Identify any adverse reaction to one or more drugs.</li>
        <li>Study the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of one or more medications, with the aim of
            determining the safety and/or efficacy of these drugs.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>CLINICAL TRIAL:</strong> A clinical study that meets any of the following conditions:
    <ol>
        <li>The subject is pre-assigned to a specific treatment strategy, which is not part of the standard clinical
            practice of the Member State concerned.
        </li>
        <li>The decision to prescribe the investigational drugs is made together with the decision to enrol the subject

        </li>
        <li>Diagnostic or follow-up procedures are applied to trial subjects, which go further than the usual clinical
            practice.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>SPONSORED CLINICAL TRIAL:</strong> These are clinical trials that are highlighted in the App because
        MATCHTRIAL has reached an agreement with the Sponsor for this purpose, which allows the entire process to be
        carried out up until the time of making the medical appointment through the App. This means that it is
        MATCHTRIAL who, with respect to the medical centres, sends (in the event of affinity between the Diagnosis and
        the purpose of the trial), after performing a pre-screening over the telephone, a blinded Diagnosis previously
        informed by the User so that the medical centre can assess whether it is a profile that has affinity with the
        patient target that the trial is recruiting. Furthermore, and in the event that the medical centre shows
        interest, MATCHTRIAL shall arrange the patient’s first visit to perform the corresponding screening prior to the
        patient’s enrolment, where appropriate, in the study. </p>
    <p><strong>MATCHTRIAL PLATFORM/PLATFORM/APPLICATION:</strong> Platform or technological app through which
        MATCHTRIAL stores public information relating to clinical trials active in Spain and, based on medical diagnoses
        entered in the Platform by registered Users, offers more accurate information on trials that show greater
        affinity with the informed diagnosis, facilitating even contact between patients and the recruiting hospitals
        for such studies. </p>
    <p><strong>SPONSOR:</strong> Individual, company, institution or organisation responsible for the initiation,
        management and/or funding of a clinical study. They can be, among others, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals,
        or even independent doctors who have their own area of research. </p>
    <p><strong>USER(S):</strong> Refers to natural persons who, after registering on the MatchTrial Platform (under the
        terms set out herein), access it and make use of the accessible services and functionalities. </p>
    <p><strong>PATIENT (User):</strong> Registered User profile relating to a natural person who suffers from a disease
        (usually cancer) and is interested in using the Platform to locate clinical trials active in Spain that have
        greater affinity with his or her diagnosis, previously informed.</p>
    <p><strong>FAMILY MEMBER (User):</strong> Registered User profile relating to a natural person who has a family
        member who suffers from a disease (usually cancer) and is interested in using the Platform to locate clinical

        informed. </p>
    <p><strong>DOCTOR (User):</strong> Registered User profile relating to a healthcare professional (usually an
        oncologist) who is interested in using the Platform to locate clinical trials active in Spain that have greater
        affinity with the diagnosis introduced and that belong to patients who are under his or her medical supervision.
    </p>
    <p><strong>INVESTIGATOR (User):</strong> Registered User profile relating to a science research professional (person
        in charge of performing the clinical trial in a clinical trial centre) who is interested in using the Platform
        to locate clinical trials active in Spain that have greater affinity with the diagnoses introduced and that
        belong to patients or clinical trial subjects that are under his or her research supervision. </p>
    <p><strong>DIAGNOSIS:</strong> Set of data provided by the User relating to the disease (usually cancer) of a
        patient that allows the Platform to analyse which clinical trials active in Spain are more in line with such
        diagnosis. </p>
    <p><strong>Pre-screening:</strong> Process in which MATCHTRIAL contacts the patient by telephone to ask a series of
        medical questions, with prior consent from the patient, in order to confirm the compatibility or affinity
        between the Diagnosis and the corresponding clinical trial identified by the Application, for the purposes of
        his or her preliminary selection to participate in the trial. </p>
    <p><strong>Screening:</strong> Process consisting of a medical visit by the patient to the corresponding hospital
        for the performance of a series of diagnostic tests in order to definitively confirm their compatibility or
        affinity and determine whether they are selected to participate in the corresponding clinical trial. </p>
    <h3>2. PURPOSE OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>These Terms are intended to regulate access to and use of the MatchTrial Platform, which is available on the
        Apple Store and Play Store.</p>
    <p>The Platform is a mobile app, so an internet connection is required to use it and it is compatible with both iOS
        and Android operating systems.</p>
    <h3>3. USE OF THE WEB PLATFORM</h3>
    <h4>3.1. Access and registration</h4>
    <p>Access to the Platform shall only be possible after downloading the Application and registration as an authorised
        User of the same, and the User shall provide the requested data (which must be truthful and accurate).</p>
    <p> The Platform is mainly aimed at three categories of Users: Patients with cancer, their Family Members, Doctors
        and Investigators. The Family Members, Doctors and Investigators profiles state that they have the corresponding
        consent from their family member and/or the patient respectively to provide information relating to diagnoses
        and the personal data that they have to provide, where appropriate (even if outside the Platform).</p>
    <p> Age. In order to register as a User and use the Platform, the User must be aged eighteen (18) years or above.
        Exceptions are cases in which the law requires the assistance of the holders of parental authority or
        guardianship for the conclusion of the legal act or activity under which consent for the processing is required.
    </p>
    <p> The administrator of the Platform, MATCHTRIAL, shall be solely responsible for managing and validating the
        User’s registration on the Platform, which shall be carried out as follows:
    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            <p> The first time the User makes use of the Platform (available free of charge through the Play Store for
                devices with an Android operating system, and the App Store for devices with an iOS operating system),
                he or she shall install it on a mobile device, access it and enter his or her data (name and surname,
                email and password) in the “Registration” section of the Platform. The Platform shall then ask the User
                to enter a mobile phone number in order to send a verification code for the User to activate the
                account.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Once the User has successfully completed the registration process, MATCHTRIAL shall register the User in
                its database of registered Users.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>3.2. Operation/Use</h4>
    <p> The purposes of registering the User on the MatchTrial Platform are mainly to:
    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            <p> Manage your registration as a User of the MatchTrial app and be able to give access to it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Manage (whether you have a Patient, Family Member, Doctor or Investigator profile) your profile as a
                User of the Platform.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide information to the User, once he or she has introduced a diagnosis (which includes the need to
                provide health data), about sponsored and non-sponsored oncology clinical trials that show greater
                affinity to the Diagnosis provided, and the hospitals participating in the study based on the distance
                from the User’s location. </p>
            <p>The system shall use the User’s location to display the nearest centres, provided that the User has
                expressly
                authorised this from the operating system and from the App itself. Alternatively, the system shall
                display
                the centres that are closest to the population informed in the configuration of the Diagnosis.</p>
        </li>
        <li> Once the User has shown interest in a specific <u>sponsored trial</u> (as indicated in Section “1.
            Definitions” of these Terms of Service<sup>1</sup>) :
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p> MATCHTRIAL shall contact the User by telephone (through a call centre) in order to carry out a
                        pre-screening (a series of medical questions) to confirm the compatibility identified by the
                        App.</p>
                    <p>In the case of a Family Member, Doctor or Investigator profile, MATCHTRIAL shall contact the User
                        to provide the contact details of the family member/patient and, subsequently, MATCHTRIAL shall
                        contact the family member/patient by telephone (through a call centre) to inform him or her of
                        the personal data collected by MATCHTRIAL, the reason why they have such data, the origin of the
                        data, the purpose for which the data is being processed, as well as to perform a pre-screening
                        that allows to confirm the “match” found by the application.</p>
                </li>
                <li> If the result of the pre-screening is negative, the User/patient shall be informed that it is not
                    possible to continue with the study, as the pre-screening shows that he or she does not meet the
                    criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> If the result of the pre-screening is positive, MATCHTRIAL shall send the anonymised diagnosis
                        of the Patient and the result of the pre-screening to the chosen hospital(s) through the
                        Platform.</p>
                    <p>In the case of a Family Member, Doctor or Investigator profile, MATCHTRIAL shall request the
                        patient’s authorization by telephone to refer the pseudonymized diagnosis, as well as the result
                        of the pre-screening, to the chosen medical centre(s) through the Platform.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> If the centres in question show their interest in such profile, MATCHTRIAL shall arrange a
                        medical visit to perform the corresponding screening in the hospital requested by the User.</p>
                    <p>For security reasons and in order to prove regulatory compliance, telephone calls, if made, shall
                        be recorded.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>With regard to <u>trials identified as a result of the search that were not sponsored</u>, the User shall
                be provided with the contact details of the medical centres so that the User can, where appropriate,
                contact them directly and evaluate directly with them the possibility of arranging a visit and
                performing the corresponding screening. In addition, MATCHTRIAL may follow up (by telephone or email)
                with the User to explain how the process works, since the User shows interest in a non-sponsored
                clinical trial, as well as to clarify any doubts that he or she may have in this regard.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> In the case of a Family Member, Doctor or Investigator profile, MATCHTRIAL shall contact the Family Member,
        Doctor or Investigator to request the patient’s contact details and, subsequently, MATCHTRIAL shall contact the
        patient to inform him or her of the personal data collected by MATCHTRIAL, the reason why they have such data
        and the purpose for which the data is being processed, as well as to explain how the process works, since the
        User showed interest in a non-sponsored clinical trial, as well as to clarify any doubts that he or she may have
        in this regard and to monitor the process. Additionally, the patient shall be provided with the contact details
        of the medical centres so that the patient can, where appropriate, contact them directly and evaluate directly
        with them the possibility of arranging a visit and performing the corresponding screening.</p>
    <p> The roles and permissions that each User has within the Platform with respect to clinical trials or studies
        shall be those granted to them by MATCHTRIAL, depending on the User’s profile.</p>

    <h4>6.2. Correct operation and continuous availability</h4>
    <p> MATCHTRIAL shall not be liable for any failure in the operation of the Platform, or for any interruption, delay,
        slowness, loss or disconnection in communications. MATCHTRIAL does not guarantee the continuous, constant and
        uninterrupted functioning and operation of the Platform and therefore assumes no liability in relation to the
        foregoing.</p>
    <p> Access to the Platform may be temporarily interrupted for maintenance, technical incidents, developments or
        modifications to the Platform and any similar issues, which the User expressly acknowledges and accepts.</p>
    <h4>6.3. Liability for damages to the User or to MATCHTRIAL</h4>
    <p> MATCHTRIAL shall not be liable for damages of any kind caused to the User as a result of the presence of viruses
        or other elements in the content that may cause alterations in the system contained in the Platform, or for
        damages caused to the User due to failures and errors in access, connections, transmissions or unjustified
        interruption of access to the Platform, intrusions, computer viruses, mass mailing or when such causes are due
        to situations beyond the control of the Platform, such as, for example, defects in the User’s computer, poor
        connection, internal viruses in the User’s computer, slow and difficult communications between the User and
        telephone operators, or when they are due to force majeure.</p>
    <p> The User shall be liable for maintaining the security of his or her device and MatchTrial account and
        immediately notify MATCHTRIAL of any unauthorised use or security breach of his or her account.</p>
    <h4>6.4. Liability for the content</h4>
    <p>MATCHTRIAL disclaims any liability with respect to any decision taken by the User as a result of the information
        contained in the Platform.</p>
    <p>Despite taking all the necessary precautions to provide current and accurate information on the Platform,
        MATCHTRIAL cannot guarantee the accuracy of all the information provided, or that it is free of errors or
        omissions, and the User must be aware that the information to which he or she has access is provided in the
        terms set out herein, without any guarantee that it is accurate and free of errors.</p>
    <p>The scientific or informative content included in the different sections of the Platform are the responsibility
        of their authors.</p>
    <p>The information collected from the sources and used in the Platform is shown as published in such sources.
        MATCHTRIAL is not responsible for any error, inconsistency or unavailability of the information included
        therein.</p>
    <h4>6.5. Liability for acts of third parties</h4>
    <p>MATCHTRIAL shall not be liable for acts performed by third parties outside the system who, by breaching the
        security measures of the Platform, perform acts against Users such as sending computer viruses, mass advertising
        or spam, commercial emails and interrupting access to the Platform.</p>
    <p>MATCHTRIAL undertakes and ensures that it has adopted all technical, organisational and legal measures for the
        security of communications, both in terms of secure connections and personal data protection. Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, MATCHTRIAL does not guarantee the total invulnerability of its security system or the
        inviolability of communications, being exempt from any type of liability if the provisions set out in the
        following section are met.</p>
    <p>MATCHTRIAL shall not be liable for damages that may occur due to force majeure or the inadequate operation of the
        Platform for reasons that are beyond its competence, such as, but not limited to, malfunctioning of telephone
        operators, insufficient capacity of the User’s computer system to support the content and extent of the
        information displayed on the Platform. However, MATCHTRIAL undertakes to use its best endeavours to solve
        technical problems, correct them or help the User to solve them.</p>
    <h4>6.6. Liability of Users and/or their family members and/or the patients for participation in clinical trials
    </h4>
    <p> It is also noted that the main functionality of the Platform is to relate medical diagnoses with ongoing
        clinical trials, in such a way as to facilitate the recruitment of patients, giving a much more active role to
        the User of the Platform (whether Patient, Family, Medical or Investigator) when searching for or managing
        access to these clinical trials.</p>
    <p> Therefore, MATCHTRIAL is limited to putting those agents (patient/recruiting medical centre) in contact with
        each other and shall not be liable under any circumstances for the patient’s enrolment in a specific clinical
        trial, or the outcome of the clinical trial, and the User shall agree to hold MATCHTRIAL completely harmless
        with respect to such liability, since MATCHTRIAL has no impact or direct relationship with the clinical trial or
        in the development of the same. </p>
    <p> For these purposes, MATCHTRIAL shall not be liable and the User (of whatever nature) also undertakes to hold
        MATCHTRIAL harmless for the inadequacy of a patient’s diagnosis to a clinical trial (sponsored or not), whether
        from the results provided by the Platform when entering the diagnostic data of the patient in question, or from
        the telephone pre-screening performed, as well as from the impossibility for the patient to participate in a
        clinical trial (or several ones) by decision of the medical centre offering it, regardless of whether the Doctor
        User or the Investigator User has been able to determine that the diagnostic profile of the patient for whom he
        or she has entered the diagnostic data on the Platform is suitable to participate in a clinical trial, since
        MATCHTRIAL, as indicated in the previous paragraph, has no direct impact or relationship with respect to the
        clinical trial or its development.</p>
    <h3>7. PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
    <p> MATCHTRIAL cares about the privacy of Users. MATCHTRIAL’s “Privacy Policy” on the use of the Platform, which is
        incorporated into these Terms, describes the types of data that MATCHTRIAL receives and collects from the User
        and that are necessary for the User’s eligibility, and the way in which MATCHTRIAL uses and shares this
        information, or the rights that the User has in relation to the processing of his or her data. The Privacy
        Policy sets out the legal basis for the processing and/or handling of the User’s personal data and/or personal
        information, including its collection, use, processing and shared use, as well as its transfer and processing in
        Spain, where MATCHTRIAL has or uses facilities, service providers, affiliated companies or partners, regardless
        of where the User accesses the Platform.</p>
    <h3>8. UPDATING THE TERMS OF USE</h3>
    <p>These Terms of Service shall be modified by MATCHTRIAL at any time. Consequently, it is the sole responsibility
        of the User to verify the terms in force each time he or she intends to use the Platform, by referring to the
        date of last update that appears in the heading of these Terms. In the event that the User continues to use the
        Platform, the modified version of the Terms shall be deemed to have been accepted unreservedly. In the event
        that the User does not agree with the new version, her or she may request the cancellation of his or her User
        profile from the system. </p>
    <h3>9. VALIDITY AND PARTIAL INVALIDITY</h3>
    <p>The declaration of nullity or invalidity of any provision herein shall not affect the validity and effectiveness
        of the other sections.</p>
    <h3>10. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws generally applicable in Spain.</p>
    <p>For the resolution of any dispute that may arise in relation to the execution or interpretation of the Terms, and
        with express waiver of the jurisdiction that may correspond to them, the User and MATCHTRIAL agree to be subject
        to the jurisdiction of local courts of the city of Barcelona, Spain. The foregoing shall not apply when the law
        provides for a mandatory jurisdiction other than that agreed between the User and MATCHTRIAL.</p>
    ______________________
    <p><small><sup>1</sup>January 7, 2021 to July 30, 2021, and as a promotion for the launch of
        the App, when the App shows non-sponsored clinical trials as a result of the search, where appropriate, and
        the User shows interest in them, MATCHTRIAL shall offer the User the same treatment that it would offer if
        the search result had offered sponsored trials and the User had shown interest in them. Therefore, during
        this period, and unless the deadline is extended by MATCHTRIAL (which shall be duly communicated),
        MATCHTRIAL shall follow the same steps as described in Section 3.2.a).ii) until the corresponding medical
        visit is arranged.</small></p>
    <p><small><sup>2</sup>MATCHTRIAL recalls and recommends that the access data shall be stored in a safe and secret
        place and not be disclosed to third parties, and that you are fully responsible for its safekeeping and
